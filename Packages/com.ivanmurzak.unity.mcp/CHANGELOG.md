# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **Namespace flattened to `AIGD`**: AI-facing data model namespace renamed from
  `com.IvanMurzak.Unity.MCP.Runtime.Data` to `AIGD` across all data types
  (`GameObjectRef`, `ComponentRef`, `AssetObjectRef`, `SceneRef`, `ObjectRef`,
  `*Data`, `*DataShallow`, `*Metadata`, `PathPatch`, etc.). Closes #676.
  Replace `using com.IvanMurzak.Unity.MCP.Runtime.Data;` with `using AIGD;`.
  This supersedes reverted PR #701 (which used an intermediate `Unity.MCP.Data` name).
- **Nested-data-model convention REVERSED**: Data classes that were previously
  declared as nested types inside MCP tool `partial` classes (e.g.,
  `Tool_GameObject.DestroyGameObjectResult`, `Tool_Assets.CopyAssetsResponse`,
  `Tool_Tool.InputData/ResultData`) have been EXTRACTED into top-level types under
  `Editor/Scripts/API/Tool/Data/` in the `AIGD` namespace. `Tool_Tool.InputData`
  was renamed to `AIGD.ToolToggleInput`; `Tool_Tool.ResultData` became `AIGD.ToolToggleResult`.
  All other extracted types preserved their original names. New AI-facing data models MUST
  be top-level types in `AIGD` (see constitution Principle IV).
- `unity-skill-create` tool guidance updated to instruct AI agents to declare data
  models as top-level types in `AIGD`, not nested inside the tool class.
- Constitution bumped 1.4.0 → 1.5.0 documenting the rule reversal and the new
  `AIGD` namespace exception in Principle IV.
